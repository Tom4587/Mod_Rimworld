<description>Vanilla Storytellers Expanded is a brand new mod series featuring standalone storytellers, bringing new, unique mechanics to the game.

"Freya believes that best stories are those of raids and glory. Every year after the first year, at the start of Aprimay your settlement will become increasingly unhappy until you send your colonists on an adventure or a raid, and bring back the spoils of war. She also limits technology to pre-industrial only."

Freya Fierce comes with the following traits:

Technology limited to Medieval
Upon world generation, this storyteller will prevent factions past medieval from spawning.

Raid Restlessness
This storyteller will make your colonists increasingly unhappy if Aprimay begins and no mission outside of your map has completed. The faction will receive a -15 debuff stacking up to 4 times. In order to reset this meter, player needs to form a caravan and either complete any out-of-your-map encounter or raid another settlement.

Random events
This storyteller will fire random events without any regard for how your colony is doing. Whilst the events still scale with wealth, their type - good, neutral, bad - is completely random, just like with Randy.</description>
