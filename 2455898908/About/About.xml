<description>Vanilla Storytellers Expanded is a brand new mod series featuring standalone storytellers, bringing new, unique mechanics to the game.

"Neron Neolithic creates a story of increasing curve of challenge and tension. The most fabled legends are created in the heat of battle, and only trial by fire will make you a better man. Most factions and all research will be limited to the neolithic era."

Neron Neolithic comes with the following traits:

Technology limited to Neolithic
Upon world generation, this storyteller will prevent factions past neolithic from spawning.

Scales with Wealth
This storyteller scales with a colony wealth being a deciding factor - the higher the wealth, the more difficult raids and bad events will happen.

Balanced Difficulty
This storyteller has balanced difficulty. It will not favour good nor bad events, and any events that happen are tailored to your colony based on it’s wealth, past events, amount of colonists and other factors.</description>
