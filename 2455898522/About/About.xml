<description>Vanilla Storytellers Expanded is a brand new mod series featuring standalone storytellers, bringing new, unique mechanics to the game.

"Diego Industrial creates a story of increasing curve of challenge and tension. He will make sure you have a breathing room between hard, difficult events. Most factions and all research will be limited to the industrial and pre-industrial eras."

Diego Industrial comes with the following traits:

Technology limited to Industrial
Upon world generation, this storyteller will prevent factions past industrial from spawning.

Scales with Wealth
This storyteller scales with a colony wealth being a deciding factor - the higher the wealth, the more difficult raids and bad events will happen.

Balanced Difficulty
This storyteller has balanced difficulty. It will not favour good nor bad events, and any events that happen are tailored to your colony based on it’s wealth, past events, amount of colonists and other factors.</description>
